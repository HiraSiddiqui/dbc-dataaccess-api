# dbc-dataaccess-api
This project contains the implementation for the DBC DataAccess API (DBC-DAAPI).

DataBlockChain.io allows data vendors to make available their data for indexing and purchasing. The API gives the data vendors the ability to allow only portions of their data (without PII) to be indexed into the DataBlockChain.io data warehouse. 

Through the API DataBlockChain.io can incrementally add to or remove records form the data warehouse.

The API allows for full record pulls once the data has been purchased by a client. 

The API allows the data vendor to track which records are being accessed for full accountability.
